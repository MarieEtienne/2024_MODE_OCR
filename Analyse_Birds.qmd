# Data presentation

The dataset (available following this link  https://zenodo.org/records/8251495 ) used for this work contains nest records from different studies conducted in North America and more specifically in Wisconsin and Illinois. It was conducted in 13 different counties : Dane, Grant, Green, Iowa, Lafayette, Monroe, Rock, Lee, Ogle, Will, Grundy, Carroll, and Jo Daviess counties. The dataset contains the records of 3257 nests and for each of them different observations.

These observations are the following:

- ***State***: Illinois or Wisconsin
- ***County***: Dane (Wisconsin), Grant (Wisconsin), Green (Wisconsin), Iowa (Wisconsin), Lafayette (Wisconsin), Monroe (Wisconsin), Rock (Wisconsin), Lee (Illinois), Ogle (Illinois), Will (Illinois), Grundy (Illinois), Carroll (Illinois), and Jo Daviess (Illinois)
- ***Habitat***: Cool-season Grassland, Pasture, Prairie, Warm-season Grassland
- ***Species***: Bobolink, Dickcissel, Eastern Meadowlark, Grasshopper Sparrow, Henslow’s Sparrow, Savannah Sparrow, Vesper Sparrow, and Western Meadowlark
- ***Years***: from 1991 to 2011
- ***Nest Fate***
- ***Initiation Date***
- ***Number fledged***
- ***Nest End Date***



All theses observations are presented in a table with the following collums : 

- *Nest_ID* = unique nest identifier
- *State* = State in which nest was located (Illinois or Wisconsin)
- *County* = County in the state in which nest was located
- *Habitat* = Grassy habitat in which nest was located (pasture, cool-season grassland, warm-season grassland, or prairie)
- *Species* = English common name
- *Year* = Year nest was found
- *Nest_Fate* = Successly fledged at least one young (1) or Failed (0).
- *Initiation_Date* = Coded date when the first egg was laid. April 1 = 1; May 1 = 31; June 1 = 62; July 1 = 92; August 1 = 123; September 1 = 154
- *Number_Fledged* = For a successful nest, number of young in nest on nest end date; For a failed nest, Number_Fledged is 0
- *Nest_End_Date* = Coded date when the nest failed or was successful. April 1 = 1; May 1 = 31; June 1 = 62; July 1 = 92; August 1 = 123; September 1 = 154

# Analysing the relationship between nest fate and county, habitat, species, year, initiation date using a generalized linear model (GLM) with a binomial distribution

## I. Data Exploration

Variables are :  

- *Nest_Fate* : Response variable, binary
- *County* : qualitative explanatory variable
- *Habitat* : qualitative explanatory variable
- *Species* : qualitative explanatory variable
- *Year* : qualitative explanatory variable
- *Initiation_Date* : Quantitative explanatory variable

**Aim of the study** : We want to model the faye of the nest as a response of the county, the habitat, the species, the year, the initiation date. We are looking for a model that could explain the distribution of Nest fate. 

**Method** : Here our response variable is either a sucess or a failure. This response follows a binomial distribution with the probability density function $$P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$

The term $$ \binom{n}{k} $$ is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) successes from \( n \) trials. 

$$ p $$ is the probability of success on a single trial. 

$$1 - p$$ is the probability of failure on a single trial.

Every statistical analysis starts with the exploration of the dataset. 

### Outlier in $Y$ 

Here we are checking the values of Y (the values of Nest Fate)
```{r dataY, echo = FALSE}
# Number of 0 and 1 in Y
table(data_Illinois$Nest_Fate)

```
According to the results table, it appears that overall, there are roughly twice as many failures as successes.


### For quantitative Xs : outlier and distribution of $X$ values

Here we have one quantitative explanatory variable $X$. We check its distribution and if there is any outlier value. 

```{r dataCov, echo = FALSE, include=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=8}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))

# Length
# Cleveland plot
dotchart(data_Illinois$Initiation_Date,pch=16,col='dodgerblue3',xlab='Initiation Date')
# Histogram
hist(data_Illinois$Initiation_Date,col='dodgerblue3',xlab="Initiation Date",main="")
# Quantile-Quantile plot
qqnorm(data_Illinois$Initiation_Date,pch=16,col='dodgerblue3',xlab='')
qqline(data_Illinois$Initiation_Date,col='red',lwd=2)
```

We do not observe any outliers and it seems that the initiation date of the nesting period follows a normal distribution. 


### For each qualitative explanatory variable $X$  : Modalities and number of individuals for each of them

We need to analyse the modalities and the number of individuals for each modality. 

```{r datafact, echo = FALSE}
# Factor County
summary(data_Illinois$County)

# Spacer
cat("\n\n")

# Factor Habitat
summary(data_Illinois$Habitat)

# Spacer
cat("\n\n")

# Factor Species
summary(data_Illinois$Species)

# Spacer
cat("\n\n")

# Factor Year
summary(data_Illinois$Year)
```
The results tables provided by our script show different things. 
First of all for the county variable we can observe that some counties have very little records. For example Carrol/Whiteside has 5 recors of nest while counties like Jo Daviess have 292 records. This could lead to mis-modelling so attention on the model results is necessary. 
For habitat variable it seems that one habitat in particular (Pasture) has more records than the other.
For the species variable, similarly to county variable, we observe that some species have more records than others. We observe the same for the year variable. 

### Relationships between Y and Xs ?

We can then analyse graphically if we might have relationships between $Y$ and $Xs$. 

```{r datagraph, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=10}
par(mfrow=c(1,3), mar=c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1) 

# Initiation_Date
plot(data_Illinois$Nest_Fate ~ data_Illinois$Initiation_Date, 
     pch=16, 
     col='dodgerblue3',
     xlab='Initiation_Date', 
     ylab='Nest_Fate',
     cex.lab=1.2,  
     cex.axis=1.2)

# Define the color palette
color <- c('dodgerblue3', 'darkred', 'forestgreen', 'gold', 
           'purple', 'orange', 'cyan', 'magenta', 
           'salmon', 'lightseagreen', 'plum', 
           'yellowgreen', 'sandybrown', 'steelblue')

# County
mosaicplot(data_Illinois$Nest_Fate ~ data_Illinois$County, 
           col = color, 
           main="", 
           cex.axis=0.8,  
           las=2)        
title("Relationship Nest Fate & County", cex.main=1.2)  

# Habitat
mosaicplot(data_Illinois$Nest_Fate ~ data_Illinois$Habitat, 
           col = color[1:4],  
           main="",  
           cex.axis=0.8,
           las=2)
title("Relationship Nest Fate & Habitat", cex.main=1.2)  

# Species
mosaicplot(data_Illinois$Nest_Fate ~ data_Illinois$Species, 
           col = color[1:8],  
           main="", 
           cex.axis=0.8,
           las=2)
title("Relationship Nest Fate & Species", cex.main=1.2)  

# Year
mosaicplot(data_Illinois$Nest_Fate ~ data_Illinois$Year, 
           col = color[1:6],  
           main="", 
           cex.axis=0.8,
           las=2)
title("Relationship Nest Fate & Year", cex.main=1.2) 


```
Looking at those graphs it doesn't seems like the initiation date, the county or the habitat has any effects on the nest fate. Maybe a little bit for county but the statistical analysis afterward will enable us to have more information on which varaible has an effect.  For the year and the species we might observe a little difference, but still really light. 

### Analysing interaction between Xs

In any modelling approach there is a need to check for interactions between variables. In our study we judges that there is none. 

### Checking collinearity  between $Xs$

To avoid multicollinearity in modeling, we need to analyze how the explanatory variables  $X_s$ are related. It is important to check for collinearity. Indeed iff some variables are correlated they mesure the same thing and therefore keeping both of them might lead to bad prediction.

```{r datacolin, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
# Vérification de la colinéarité entre variables catégorielles

# Tableau de contingence entre County et Habitat
table(data_Illinois$County, data_Illinois$Habitat)


# Tableau de contingence entre Species et Year
table(data_Illinois$Species, data_Illinois$Year)

# Tableau de contingence entre habitat et Species
table(data_Illinois$Habitat, data_Illinois$Species)


# Boxplots pour vérifier la relation entre Initiation_Date et les variables catégorielles

# Initiation_Date et County
boxplot(data_Illinois$Initiation_Date ~ data_Illinois$County, 
        xlab="County", 
        ylab="Initiation Date", 
        cex.axis=0.8)          

# Initiation_Date et Habitat
boxplot(data_Illinois$Initiation_Date ~ data_Illinois$Habitat, 
        xlab="Habitat", 
        ylab="Initiation Date", 
        cex.axis=0.8)         

# Initiation_Date et Species
boxplot(data_Illinois$Initiation_Date ~ data_Illinois$Species, 
        xlab="Species", 
        ylab="Initiation Date", 
        cex.axis=0.4)         

# Initiation_Date et Year
boxplot(data_Illinois$Initiation_Date ~ data_Illinois$Year, 
        xlab="Year", 
        ylab="Initiation Date", 
        cex.axis=0.8)         

```
Here it seems that there is a strong collinearity between county and habitat as well as between species and year and also between species and habitat. Therefore, we are not going to keep county, habitat and year as explanatory variables in our model. 


## II. Statistical Analysis

### Model building up


Because our response variable is a binary variable that follows a binomial distribution we have a link function : the logit. 

 
```{r fullmodel,echo = FALSE}
# Model formulation
mod1<-glm(Nest_Fate~Species
        + Initiation_Date
        ,data=data_Illinois
        ,family=binomial(link="logit"))
# Then we check for significance
drop1(mod1,test="Chi")
```

The results table shows that Initiation_Date is not significant. However the AIC with Initiation_Date is better which means we should keep this variable despite its lack of significance.



### Model coefficient and its equation
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Coefficients of the model
summary(mod1)

```
$$\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = -1.097853 + 0.189410 \cdot \text{Species}_{\text{Dickcissel}} - 0.382551 \cdot \text{Species}_{\text{Eastern Meadowlark}} + 0.664586 \cdot \text{Species}_{\text{Grasshopper Sparrow}} - 0.327407 \cdot \text{Species}_{\text{Henslow's Sparrow}} - 0.655641 \cdot \text{Species}_{\text{Savannah Sparrow}} + 0.180147 \cdot \text{Species}_{\text{Vesper Sparrow}} + 0.961508 \cdot \text{Species}_{\text{Western Meadowlark}} + 0.000686 \cdot \text{Initiation\_Date}$$


where $p$ is the probability that the event is true. 


- **Intercept (-1.097853)**: The value of the log-odds when all explanatory variables are zero.
- **Species Dickcissel (0.189410)**: A positive coefficient, but not significant (\(p = 0.56565\)), indicating that the effect of this species on the chances of nest success is not statistically significant.
- **Species Eastern Meadowlark (-0.382551)**: A negative coefficient, not significant (\(p = 0.25424\)).
- **Species Grasshopper Sparrow (0.664586)**: A positive and significant coefficient (\(p = 0.03505\)), suggesting that this species increases the chances of nest success.
- **Species Henslow's Sparrow (-0.327407)**: A negative coefficient, not significant (\(p = 0.77686\)).
- **Species Savannah Sparrow (-0.655641)**: A negative coefficient, not significant (\(p = 0.42549\)).
- **Species Vesper Sparrow (0.180147)**: A positive coefficient, not significant (\(p = 0.66871\)).
- **Species Western Meadowlark (0.961508)**: A positive and significant coefficient (\(p = 0.02092\)).
- **Initiation Date (0.000686)**: A positive coefficient, but not significant (\(p = 0.86557\)), indicating that it does not have a statistically significant effect on nest success.



### Explanation provided by the model

One way to evaluate the goodness of fit for our models is to assess the difference between our model and the null model (which summarizes the data with a single parameter: the mean of𝑌)
Y). This null model essentially explains nothing. 
To do so we calculate a parameter, $${pseudo}-R^2$$ by examining the distance between the deviance of the null model and the residual deviance of our model.

```{r deviance, echo = FALSE}
# Estimate of deviance explained
(mod1$null.deviance-mod1$deviance)/mod1$null.deviance

# Some others estimates of deviance explained - package 'rcompanion'
nagelkerke(mod1)
```
According to this table, the estimate of the explained deviance is 2.9% which is very low. 

## III. Model validation


### Checking for influential individuals

We make sure that there is no influential individuals. 

```{r Contri, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(cooks.distance(mod1), type = "h", ylim = c(0, 1))
abline(h = 1, col = 2,lwd = 3)
```

The graph does not show any influential individuals. 


### Prediction with different data

Here we want to assess if our model is able to well-classify nest based on our data. 

```{r Simul, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}

# We could do a simulation
N    <- nrow(data_Illinois)
Pi   <- fitted(mod1)
data_Illinois$Ysim <- rbinom(N, size = 1, Pi)
# Classification table
Z <- table(data_Illinois$Nest_Fate, data_Illinois$Ysim) / N
rownames(Z) <- c("Observed 0", "Observed 1")
colnames(Z) <- c("Predicted 0", "Predicted 1")
Z
#Correctly classified:
sum(diag(Z))

# And repeat this 1000 times, store the results and calculate an average classification table

Pi   <- fitted(mod1)
N    <- nrow(data_Illinois)					
NSim <- 1000                           
diagZ<- matrix(nrow = N, ncol = NSim)
for (i in 1:NSim) {
  Ysim <- rbinom(N, size = 1, Pi)
  Z<- table(data_Illinois$Nest_Fate, Ysim) / N
  diagZ[,i]<-sum(diag(Z))
  }
#Average rate of individuals well-classified by the model
boxplot(diagZ[2,], col='dodgerblue3',ylab='#Rate of nest fate well-classified')
mean(diagZ[2,])
```
Here we have 58% of good predictions, which is somewhat below the common threshold of 70% for a model to be considered good. This suggests that the model may need improvement.

This result is not surprising given our initial data. Because they are from different studies some variables barely contains some species or years, etc... This could explain while our model is not suitable.
