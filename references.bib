	abstract = {Surrogate grasslands established through federal set-aside programs, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program ({CRP}), provide important habitat for grassland birds. Warm season grass {CRP} fields as a group have the potential for providing a continuum of habitat structure for breeding birds, depending on how the fields are managed and their floristic composition. We studied the nesting activity of four obligate grassland bird species, Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), and Henslow's Sparrow (A. henslowii), in relation to vegetative composition and fire management in warm season {CRP} fields in southwest Wisconsin during 2009–2011. Intraspecific variation in apparent nest density was related to the number of years since the field was burned. Apparent Grasshopper Sparrow nest density was highest in the breeding season immediately following spring burns, apparent Henslow's Sparrow nest density was highest 1 y post burn, and apparent Bobolink and Eastern Meadowlark nest densities were higher in post fire years one to three. Grasshopper Sparrow nest density was highest on sites with more diverse vegetation, specifically prairie forbs, and on sites with shorter less dense vegetation. Bobolink, Eastern Meadowlark, and Henslow's Sparrow apparent nest densities were higher on sites with deeper litter; litter was the vegetative component that was most affected by spring burns. Overall nest success was 0.487 for Bobolink (22 d nesting period), 0.478 for Eastern Meadowlark (25 d nesting period), 0.507 for Grasshopper Sparrow (22 d nesting period), and 0.151 for Henslow's Sparrow (21 d nesting period). The major nest predators were grassland-associated species: thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), milk snake (Lampropeltis triangulum), American badger (Taxidea taxus), and western fox snake (Elaphe vulpina). Overall depredation rate was not affected by the number of years since the site had been burned. The diversity of vegetation on warm season {CRP} fields created by management using fire provides a continuum of structure for obligate grassland birds to use for breeding and habitat for a diversity of nest predators.},

	abstract = {Some grassland passerine species are considered area-sensitive, but the mechanisms underlying that phenomenon are not understood, particularly on grazed grasslands. Area sensitivity may result from edge avoidance or higher nest predation near edges, both of which may be influenced by predator activity or cattle-induced vegetational differences between pasture edge and interior. We assessed the effect of distance to edge on nest density and predation Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), and meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) along wooded and nonwooded edges of Wisconsin pastures in 1998-2000 and the activity of potential mammalian nest predators along those edges in 2000-2001. We found a positive relationship between nest density and distance from edge for all edge types combined, but that was not the result of effects of wooded edges: we found no difference in density between nests located \&lt;50 or \&lt;100 m from wooded versus nonwooded (crop or grassland) edges. Models that included combinations of vegetation structure (e.g. concealment), initiation date, year, or edge variables (or all four) were poor predictors of the probability of nest predation. Placing nests away from edges, therefore, did not reduce the risk of nest predation. Eight species known to prey on grassland bird nests were documented along pasture edges, raccoon (Procyon lotor) being the most common. Frequency of raccoon and thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) visitation was higher along wooded edges and nonwooded edges, respectively. Cattle (Bos taurus) activity did not differentially affect vegetation height-density along edges compared with that in the pasture interior. Possible reasons for predation risk being similar in both pasture interiors and edges in a fragmented landscape include the ease with which predators can move within pastures, high percentage of resident grassland predators, and small size (median = 47.2 ha) of pastures.},

	abstract = {We measured the diversity, density, nest success, and productivity of grassland birds on three types of sites in southwestern Wisconsin: ungrazed grasslands, continuously grazed pastures, and rotationally grazed pastures. We found that diversity, density, nest success, and productivity were highest on ungrazed grasslands. Continuously grazed pastures had the lowest diversity and density but intermediate nest success and productivity. Rotationally grazed pastures had intermediate diversities and densities but the lowest nest success and productivity. We recommend a grassland management regime in which areas of ungrazed grassland and rotationally grazed pastures are maintained in a 1:2 ratio on farms during the nesting season (15 May-l July). Our data suggest that such a management regime would result in per-farm avian productivity that is higher than on continuously grazed and rotationally grazed pastures and much higher than that reported for frequently mowed hayfields.},

We monitored 280 nests of 9 grassland-bird species from mid-May to late July 2000–2002. Pooecetes gramineus (Vesper Sparrow) and Ammodramus savannarum (Grasshopper Sparrow) were the most abundant nesting species. Vesper Sparrow nest densities were highest on smaller grassland patches, while Grasshopper Sparrow nest densities were highest on the largest patches. Probability of fledging at least one young was 0.20 for Vesper Sparrow. For Grasshopper Sparrow, daily nest survival was higher for nests placed away from trees; probability of fledging at least one young was 0.28 for nests away from trees and 0.05 for nests near trees. Maintaining remnant native habitats is important, and management of woody features may help improve habitat quality for some grassland birds in Wisconsin.},
